# ML_Classification-of-features
基于机器学习的多光谱遥感地物分类技术
• Use the KNN, SVM, decision tree, Naive Baye, and CNN algorithm to calculate the accuracy and recall rate. The accuracy of the CNN algorithm is 0.95
• Plot the ROC curve and the confusion matrix separately for the results of the different algorithms
